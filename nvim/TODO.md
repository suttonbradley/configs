## Short list
- [ ] harpoon
- [ ] toggle term
- [ ] null ls
- [x] use keybinds from that video for buffer switching
- [x] telescope bind to open file in new column

## Definitely
- [ ] neotree toggle vs focus - better keybinds
- [ ] terminal within nvim
- [ ] keybinds for opening side by side code
- [ ] insert matching beginning/end parens/brackets
- [x] workspaces. Wants:
  - same files to be open when I open up a dir again
  - switch between dirs without leaving nvim

## Maybe
- [ ] debugger [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2mKJ73M9pg) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYzZxi3SSnM&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn&index=6)
- [ ] code folding
- [ ] cargo fmt integration
- [ ] ripgrep plugin
- [ ] Obsidian plugin
- [ ] Project switching
  - When accidentally using LazyVim, there was a plugin for this
  - What does the workflow look like with this and terminal stuff?
    - One terminal tab for each project, or using `nu` shell switcher + single vim window?
- [ ] ADO integration -- see PR comments for easier fixing?
- [ ] `nushell` LSP
- neo-tree
  - [ ] change to glyphs for git changes in neo-tree
  - [ ] way to focus without having to `ctrl+n` twice

## Done
- [x] snippets [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXIwm4mCpuc&list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn&index=5)
- [x] show git change indicators per-line
- Better Rust support
  - [x] consider using [rustaceanvim](https://github.com/mrcjkb/rustaceanvim)
- [x] show line numbers
- [x] LSPs
- [x] make home work as expected, should map to `^`
