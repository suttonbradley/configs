## Definitely
- [ ] create/delete/rename file without going to terminal
- [ ] show line numbers
- [ ] show git change indicators per-line
- [ ] match beginning/end parens/brackets
- [ ] make home work as expected, should map to `^`
- Better Rust support
  - [ ] consider using [rustaceanvim](https://github.com/mrcjkb/rustaceanvim)
  - [ ] [this blog post](https://rsdlt.github.io/posts/rust-nvim-ide-guide-walkthrough-development-debug/)
- [x] LSPs

## Maybe
- [ ] cargo fmt integration
- [ ] ripgrep plugin
- [ ] Obsidian plugin
- [ ] Project switching
  - When accidentally using LazyVim, there was a plugin for this
  - What does the workflow look like with this and terminal stuff?
    - One terminal tab for each project, or using `nu` shell switcher + single vim window?
- [ ] ADO integration -- see PR comments for easier fixing?
- [ ] `nushell` LSP
- neo-tree
  - [ ] change to glyphs for git changes in neo-tree
  - [ ] way to focus without having to `ctrl+n` twice
